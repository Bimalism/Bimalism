1. Philosophical and Ideological Security
Core Principle Integrity:

The foundational texts and principles of Bimalism must be preserved in their authentic form.

Any official interpretation or expansion must be clearly documented and attributed to prevent misrepresentation.

A designated body (e.g., a steering committee) is responsible for authenticating official communications and materials.

Countering Misinformation:

Actively monitor public channels for misrepresentation or malicious co-opting of the Bimalist name and ideals.

Maintain a single, authoritative source of truth (e.g., an official website) to provide clarity and counter false narratives.

Develop clear, consistent messaging to address common misconceptions.

2. Digital and Information Security
Access Control:

Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Individuals are granted only the access rights necessary to perform their specific functions.

Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical systems (websites, social media, financial accounts).

Regularly review and revoke access for former contributors or those whose roles have changed.

Data Protection:

Minimal Data Collection: Only collect personal data that is absolutely essential for operational purposes.

Encryption: All sensitive data, especially personal information of members and financial data, must be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.

Clear Privacy Policy: Maintain a publicly available privacy policy that explains what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected.

Platform and Infrastructure Security:

Official Channels: Designate and secure official communication channels (website, email, social media). Publicly list these to prevent impersonation.

Software Hygiene: Keep all software, plugins, and systems updated with the latest security patches.

Secure Backups: Perform regular, automated backups of all critical data and website content. Store backups securely, separate from the primary system.

3. Communication and Community Security
Official Communication Protocol:

Distinguish clearly between official Bimalism statements and individual member opinions.

Establish a verification process for community members to confirm the authenticity of major announcements.

Community Moderation:

Foster a respectful environment in forums and discussion groups. Establish and enforce clear community guidelines against harassment, hate speech, and disruptive behavior.

Empower a trusted moderation team to address security concerns, spam, and malicious actors within community spaces.

Social Engineering Defense:

Educate members and leaders that they will never be asked for passwords or financial contributions via unverified channels (e.g., direct messages on social media).

Verify any unusual requests through a secondary, pre-established communication method (e.g., a phone call to a known number).

4. Financial Security
Financial Transparency:

Maintain clear and transparent records of all income (donations, sales) and expenditures.

Conduct regular financial audits, either internal or by a third party, to ensure accountability.

Transaction Security:

Use reputable, secure payment processors for any financial transactions.

Require dual authorization for significant financial movements, ensuring no single individual has unilateral control over funds.

5. Physical Security (If Applicable)
Event Security:

For physical gatherings or events, conduct a basic risk assessment.

Ensure the safety and privacy of attendees and speakers.

Have a clear plan for handling disruptions or emergencies.

Asset Protection:

Securely store any physical assets, such as documents or equipment.

6. Incident Response Plan
Preparation:

Designate an Incident Response Team with clear roles and responsibilities.

Maintain an updated contact list for key decision-makers.

Identification & Containment:

If a security breach is suspected (e.g., hacked account, data leak), the priority is to contain it immediatelyâ€”such as by revoking access, taking a website offline, or warning the community.

Communication:

In the event of a significant incident, communicate transparently with the community about what happened, what is being done, and what they should do (e.g., reset passwords).

Post-Incident Review:

After resolving the incident, conduct a review to understand the root cause and update policies and procedures to prevent a recurrence.

Policy Acknowledgment:

All individuals in leadership or operational roles within the Bimalism framework are required to understand and adhere to this security policy. Security is a shared responsibility, fundamental to preserving the integrity and future of the movement.
